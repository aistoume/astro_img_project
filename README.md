# Astro VAE: Exoplanet Disk Background Removal

This project applies a deep learning modelâ€”specifically a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)â€”to improve imaging of exoplanetary disks by removing background noise from astronomical FITS images.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

- `Astro_VAE_Modeling_V1.ipynb`: Main notebook for background removal using VAE.
- `assets/`: Contains `.fits` files used for training and masking.
- `astro_vae_package/`: Custom utilities and plotting tools.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install numpy astropy matplotlib opencv-python imageio tensorflow torch scikit-learn
```

### Run the Notebook

1. Launch Jupyter Notebook or VSCode.
2. Open `Astro_VAE_Modeling_V1.ipynb`.
3. Execute the cells in order to:
   - Load FITS data
   - Apply spatial masks
   - Train and evaluate the VAE model

## ðŸ§  Model Overview

The project utilizes a PyTorch or TensorFlow-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to reconstruct clean versions of images by learning from control regions (ring masks) and predicting noisy or masked regions.

## ðŸ“ˆ Visualization

Output plots and intermediate steps are visualized using Matplotlib and saved as images or PDF files.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes

- GPU support is included using PyTorch (`torch.cuda.is_available()`).
- FITS image files are preprocessed using `utils.crop_central_squared_image`.

## âœ¨ Acknowledgments

This project builds on earlier work by Fang and integrates custom astronomy utilities for image masking and visualization.
